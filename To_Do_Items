To do items (secondary additions):

#1 : add ability for oases to limit the amount of resources any player can withdraw from them at any one time with any raid
#2 : add in defenders for oases, actually make these functional and implemented
#3 : add in ability for oases to refresh their holdings based on the time elapsed since they were last checked.
#4 : as number 3, but for habitable squares in villages
#5 : create a hero class, give ability for players to own heroes
#6 : add in various playable races (much later stage!!!)
#7 : create function which ensures village names are globally distinct, and allows change
#8 : create function which allows villages to be added to player data, and removed, as needed
#9 : create walls and rally point building data, include in village class on creation
#10 : villages contain a "currently upgrading" field to hold current upgrades. How do we actually use this?
#11 : villages contain the function "modify_building_time" which updates based on main building level. How and when should it be called?
#12 : thought related to N11 : possibly create a function which checks the various things that might need to be called, and calls them as needed each update cycle.
