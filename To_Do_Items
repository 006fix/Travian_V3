To do items (secondary additions):

#1 : add ability for oases to limit the amount of resources any player can withdraw from them at any one time with any raid
#2 : add in defenders for oases, actually make these functional and implemented
#3 : add in ability for oases to refresh their holdings based on the time elapsed since they were last checked.
#4 : as number 3, but for habitable squares in villages
#5 : create a hero class, give ability for players to own heroes
#6 : add in various playable races (much later stage!!!)
#7 : create function which ensures village names are globally distinct, and allows change
#8 : create function which allows villages to be added to player data, and removed, as needed
#9 : create walls and rally point building data, include in village class on creation
#10 : villages contain a "currently upgrading" field to hold current upgrades. How do we actually use this?
#11 : villages contain the function "modify_building_time" which updates based on main building level. How and when should it be called?
#12 : thought related to N11 : possibly create a function which checks the various things that might need to be called, and calls them as needed each update cycle.
#13 : villages contain a function "calculate cp" which updates total CP values. However i suspect in its current iteration it will also calculate for newly built buildings, and shouldn't.
#14 : villages current identify if a building can be identified via a basic "True"/"False" flag. this needs to be updated later to include better logic, including the ability to lock some upgrades behind other critiera.
#15 : much longer term idea. for the AI to have a better understanding of what it *could* do, I might want to incorporate some logic that shows it what it could possibly gain. i.e if I invade this oasis, i could gain x amount of resources
#16 : fields in non capital villages will at some point need to cap at level 10
#17 : every building will need a specialist function in addition to the generic update stats function to update building specific stats
